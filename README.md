* A Polymer inspired data binding system.

For more details see [overview doc](./doc/overview.md).


### Demo and tutorial app

[daflight](https://github.com/jonboj/daflight) is small demo and tutorial app written for illustration of concepts in the mdcdalight lib. Hosted build of daflight : https://tid4sport.com/daflight/web    

How to import from [mdc web][mdcweb] is described in [mdc web import](./doc/mdcwebimport.md)    

### To be implemented

Unimplemented funtionality are listed here [what is next](./doc/overview.md#what-is-next). Until web componets v1 becomes available in the dart development environment, the effort is focused on functionality unrelated to web components and build system.
